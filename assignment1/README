-==============================================================-

The files make up the 'studentdb' program:
 
 - main.cpp/.h              : Contains main method, menu loop, and utility methods
 - cmdline_parser.cpp/.h    : Wrapper for the boost command line argument parser
 - database.cpp/.h          : Class stub for the database object
 - student_record.cpp/.h    : Class stub for the student record object
 - makefile                 : The makefile for the project
 - studentdb                : The executable produced by the makefile
 - README                   : This file

 Part one of this assignment was to just build a text based menu system and to develop 
 method and class stubs for part two of the assignment. 

 The database.cpp object contains the menu method stubs since all of the menu options 
 are operations for the database to perform. This may change in part two when things get more complex.

 HOW TO BUILD:
 $ make

 HOW TO RUN:
 $ ./studentdb
 OR
 $ ./studentdb -d "somedatabasefile.txt"

 HOW TO CLEAN:
 $ make clean
