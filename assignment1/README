-==============================================================-

This studentdb program provides a text based menu for interaction with a list of
student records. Records contain student information as well as marks making up their 
class record, and are listed and controlled in a Database object.

Loading and Saving from a file are used to make the database persistant, when a database is loaded, it
clears the existing content before adding the new records.

Records are sorted alphabetically on the student number and duplicates are always overwritten.

The files make up the 'studentdb' program:
 
 - main.cpp/.h              : Contains main method, menu loop, and utility methods
 - cmdline_parser.cpp/.h    : Wrapper for the boost command line argument parser
 - database.cpp/.h          : Database object that contains the menu methods. Database object is managed here.
 - student_record.cpp/.h    : Student Record Object
 - input_utils.cpp/.h       : Safe / Sanitised input methods available everywhere.
 - makefile                 : The makefile for the project
 - studentdb                : The executable produced by the makefile
 - README                   : This file
